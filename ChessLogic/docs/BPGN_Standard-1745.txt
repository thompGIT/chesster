1. Introduction

1.1 Reason for BPGN

   The PGN standard has been very successful in providing a standard format
   for regular chess games and positions. There are now hundreds of thousands
   of games available in the PGN format. It is desirable to have a similar
   system for bughouse games. This document contains a proposal for a BPGN 
   format (Bughouse Portable Game Notation). This will enable the development 
   of bughouse theory by allowing the recording and analysis of bughouse
   matches.

   This standard is intended primarily for games played on the internet
   chess servers. These games represent the majority of bughouse matches 
   being played as well as the highest quality. Very few OTB bughouse matches
   are recorded because Bughouse is usually played with short time controls.


1.2 Details of problem

   There are several aspects of Bughouse that make it unsuitable for the
   regular PGN standard.

      1. A bughouse match is composed of two separate chess games. What happens
         on one board may not make sense unless the situation on the other
         board is known.
      2. When replaying a match, move order and time used are crucial to
         the understanding of the match. One important tactic in Bughouse is to
         get an advantage in time and then sit and wait for a crucial piece.
         Likewise many bughouse sacrifices seem nonsensical without knowledge of
         the other game.

2. BPGN Standard 1.0 (DrZukhar)

2.1 Proposed solution

   BPGN is based on the existing PGN standard. Rather than re-quote the
   entire PGN document only the differences between the file types will be
   described here. Relevant sections of the PGN standard will be referenced
   by number. 
    
    BPGN is designed to record bughouse *matches*. A match consists of two 
    boards. The boards are designated A and B.

    Here’s a crude diagram showing the basic configuration:

             BlackA                    WhiteB
        +---------------+         +---------------+
        |               |         |               |
        |               |         |               |
        |               |         |               |
        |    Board A    |         |    Board B    |
        |               |         |               |
        |               |         |               |
        |               |         |               |
        |               |         |               |
        +---------------+         +---------------+
             WhiteA                    BlackB
     
    WhiteA and BlackB form one team.

    PGN has a mandatory seven tag roster (see PGN standard section 8.1.1).
    For BPGN these tags have been changed slightly to support bughouse matches.

        [Event] - the name of the tournament or match event
            example: [Event "fics rated bughouse match"]
        This tag indicates that it’s a bughouse match and whether it’s 
        rated or unrated. See PGN standard section 8.1.1.1 for details.

        [Site] - the location of the event
            example: [Site "fics, Oklahoma City, OK USA"]
        This is the location of the server the game was played on. It’s 
        important information because player names can vary between servers.
        WhoAmI on FICS isn’t necessarily the same player as WhoAmI on ICC.
        See PGN standard section 8.1.1.2 for details on the format for Site.

        [Date] - the starting date of the game
            example: [Date "1996.08.07"]
        The date tag is always in the format YYYY.MM.DD. See PGN standard 
        section 8.1.1.3 for details on correct Date formatting. 

        [Round] - the playing round ordinal of the game
            example: [Round -1-]
        While this is mandatory for PGN file, Round is not a mandatory BPGN
        tag. It is optional because most bughouse games are not part of a
        tournament or match. See PGN section 8.1.1.4.

        [WhiteA] - the player of the white pieces on the A board
        [WhiteB] - the player of the white pieces on the B board
        [BlackA] - the player of the black pieces on the A board
        [BlackB] - the player of the black pieces on the B board 
            example: [WhiteA "raven"]
                     [BlackA "Gnejs"]
                     [WhiteB "Paaso"]
                     [BlackB "death"]

        [WhiteAElo] - the rating of the white player on the A board
        [WhiteBElo] - the rating of the white player on the B board 
        [BlackAElo] - the rating of the black player on the A board 
        [BlackBElo] - the rating of the black player on the B board 
	    example: [WhiteAElo "2165"]
                     [BlackAElo "2724"]
                     [WhiteBElo "1925"]
                     [BlackBElo "2307"]
        The name and rating tags are often combined on one line for
        readability.
            example: [WhiteA "raven"][WhiteAElo "2165"]
                     [BlackA "Gnejs"][BlackAElo "2724"]
        See PGN standard section 9.1.2 for details on formatting ratings.
	
	[TimeControl] - the time control of the game, the format is
	 starting time in seconds + increment in seconds
            example: [TimeControl "300+0"]

        [Result] - the result of the game
            example: [Result "0-1"]
        The [Result] tag is stated in terms of the White player on board A.
        "1-0" means his team won, "0-1" means his team lost. See PGN standard
        section 8.1.1.7 for details on how to format Result tags.

    The biggest difference between the notations is the actual game score.
    In order to maintain continuity both games are recorded together.
    This preserves the sequence of the match. In order to distinguish 
    between the two games the move numbers have a letter added to identify
    which player made the move. In a bughouse match there are 4 first moves
    which may occur in any order (well, not *any* order, white still moves 
    first). So move numbers on board A have a letter added. Uppercase for
    White, lowercase for black. 

        1A. e4      Board A white's first move
        1a. Nf6     Board A black's first move
        1B. Nf3     Board B white's first move
        1b. Nc6     Board B black's first move

    Also the amount of time remaining in the game is recorded
    (in seconds as reported by the server). This number is in parenthesis
    after the move ex: 1A. e4 {178}  In a 3 minute game this would indicate
    that White on Board A took 2 seconds to play e4.

    The actual movetext follows the PGN standard section 8.2.3 with the
    exception of drop moves. Drops are indicated using the @ sign. So the
    text N@g5 means a knight was dropped on the g5 square. P@f7 indicates
    that a pawn was dropped on f7.

3. BPGN Standard 1.1 (WhoAmI)

3.1 Addition of commentary information 

    BugMaster WhoAmI's program 'BPGN viewer' uses the following symbols
    *inside* parenthesis to mean specific things to his program:

       {A:...} an annotation, for example 1.e4 {29} {A:!} stands for 1. e4! in the four column display
       {C:...} a comment 
       {D:}    a diagram should be inserted here
               (used when printing the game in four column mode)

    This isn't part of the BPGN standard, but it's not illegal since it's inside
    parenthesis.

3.2 Inserting variations of the main line

    Variations played while studying the game can be saved in the BPGN file by the use of round brackets;
    nested variations are equally permitted.

    As an example consider this sequence of moves

    47A. P@f7+ {112} (47A. N@e7+ {114} 47a. Kf7 {20} 48A. Nd5 {114} (48A. Ng6 {114} 
    48a. hxg6 {20}) 48a. exd5 {20}) 47a. Kxf7 {19} (47A. P@e7 {114})

    Which, in a somewhat more readable format should be intrepreted as

    47A. P@f7+ {112}                                          --> Level 0: Main line
	(47A. N@e7+ {114} 47a. Kf7 {20} 48A. Nd5 {114}        --> Level 1: first deviation
		(48A. Ng6 {114} 48a. hxg6 {20})               --> Level 2: first deviation 
	48a. exd5 {20})                                       --> Level 1: first deviation continued
        (47A. P@e7 {114})                                     --> Level 1: second deviation
    47a. Kxf7 {19}                                            --> Level 0: Main line

3.3 BFEN Extension
    
    Thief 1.0 introduced 2 new tags in BPGN. Tag Setup "1" indicates that BPGN starts from 
    position different from normal initial bughouse position. It should be followed by FEN 
    tag that encodes the starting position in BFEN format.

    BFEN is an extension of the FEN format for describing an arbitrary bughouse position. 
    It is used for logging adjourned games (resuming a game). It can also be used to log 
    Fisher random bughouse games.


    BFEN example: 
    
    r2k1r2/pbppNppp/1p2p1nb/1P5N/3N4/4Pn1q/PPP1QP1P/2KR2R1/BrpBBqppN w - - 45 56 | Q~4rk1/8/8/8/8/8/8/R3K2R w KQ - 45 60 
    
    Specificiations
    ***************
    
    As you see in the example, bfen has the following structure: board A
    bfen, followed by separator '|' followed by board B bfen. 
    
    Board A bfen has the following structure: 
    -----------------------------------------
    	
    1. standard FEN for position
    Fen consists of 8 parts separated by slash
    (r2k1r2/pbppNppp/1p2p1nb/1P5N/3N4/4Pn1q/PPP1QP1P/2KR2R1). Each part
    represents a rank on the chessboard. The first part(r2k1r2) represents
    8th rank and the last part (2KR2R1) represents 1st rank. Numbers in fen
    stand for empty squares, letters in lowercase stand for black pieces and
    letters in uppercase stand for white pieces. For example, r2k1r2 means
    black rook (on a-file) followed by 2 empty squares (on files "b" and
    "c") , followed by black king (on d-file), followed by an empty square
    (on e-file) followed by black rook (on f-file), followed by 2 empty
    squares (on g- and h-files). 
    There is one modification from the normal FEN: ~ after piece denotes
    promoted piece (on board B white queen on a8 is a promoted one) 
    
    2. slash(/)
    
    3. holdings 
    BrpBBqppN; pieces in uppercase belong to white, pieces in lowercase belong
    to black; in the example white holds 3 bishops and a knight, black holds 
    rook, queen and 3 pawns 
    
    4. space
    
    5. side to move (w if white's move, b if black's move),
    
    6. space

    7. castling possibilities 
    Dash denotes that nobody can castle, K=white can castle kingside, k=black
    can castle kingside, Q=white can castle queenside, q=black can castle 
    queenside. On board A we have we have dash in the BFEN, so nobody can 
    castle. On board B we have KQ in the bfen, ergo white can castle both 
    kingside and queenside, while black cannot castle at all. 
    
    8. space
    
    9. enpassant posibilities 
    Dash=no enpassant possible, otherwise enpassant square,i.e e3 or d6, etc. 
    In our example there are no enpassant possibilities.
    
    10. space
     
    11. white's time in seconds (45)
    
    12. space
    
    13. black's time in seconds (56) 
    
    
    Board B bfen 
    ------------
    
    Board B bfen has similar structure. You may notice that pieces in hand are absent, so
    holdings and slash before holdings are omited. 
    
    Finally a game example which illustrates the use of the setup and fen tag:

4. BPGN Standard 1.2 

Possibly will include movetimes in milliseconds and lag per move.

Skacz suggest the following format:
Lag per move could be denoted like {L:100} 
Movetimes in milliseconds could possibly be denoted like {T:1200} (thinking time!)

I would suggest just to use the time left on the clock in milliseconds, for example
 Qxa1 {159.3} as to avoid clutter.
