if someone forfeits on time, bughousedb.org seems to record whatever their prior move was at time 0
to be the move at top zero, with comment that they lost on time ....

notice here that move 35a is repeated

35A. Rd2{0.385} 35a. B@g4+{57.392} 29b. Kb8{62.265} 30B. Qxd8+{18.241} 35a. B@g4+{57.392} {Conquerer forfeits on time} 0-1

sjeng gets this completely wrong ... :/ ugh debug

PGN - portable game notation
    - the file format of saved games, including the tags, comments, moves
      lists, result tokens, etc.
FEN - Forsyth-Edwards notation
    - that long string that holds the state of the board (discluding time)
    - CAN be part of PGN
SAN - standard algebraic notation
    - that often ambiguous notation for encoding specific moves
    - is a part of PGN
    - is NOT part of FEN
